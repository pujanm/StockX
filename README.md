# NSE FutureTech 2018 Machine Learning Hackathon
## Problem Statement:
### Market Event based trading
Generate or recommend trading orders based on news feeds. Solve for creating orders based on any
change to the economic affairs of a country or industry or company and the knock-on impacts on the
share markets. Generate basket orders based on sector news, e.g. banking stock in response to
change in interest rates, forex rates, and negative or positive media coverage.
## Solution:
### Here the user enters the Stock Name and the number of tweets from which the user wants the stock review.

### Then the user gets the sentiment for the stock and the opening price of the stock for the next day.

This was our solution to Stock Price Prediction based on media coverage(Twitter). We used ANNs for NLP task (Yes I know that sounds wrong but we were stupid at that time).

We welcome more ideas!
