## Problem Statement:
### Market Event based trading
Generate or recommend trading orders based on news feeds. Solve for creating orders based on any
change to the economic affairs of a country or industry or company and the knock-on impacts on the
share markets. Generate basket orders based on sector news, e.g. banking stock in response to
change in interest rates, forex rates, and negative or positive media coverage.
